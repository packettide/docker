# Docker Dev Stack

## The Main Question
### How long will it take me to set this up?
5-15 minutes, not including download time and if you're familiar with terminal commands.

## Overview
### What is this?
At it's core, this is just a BASH script that creates the files necessary to setup a local development stack (devstack) for Docker for Mac (PHP, MySQL, and Nginx; Apache coming soon).

### Can I just run Docker for Mac without this?
Yes, you can, but if you're familiar with Docker, each service runs as it's own container and you have to link all the other containers your running together. This isn't hard necessarily, but it can be confusing to get up to speed on how everything needs to work and is extremely tedious to do manually.

If you're not familiar with Docker, this devstack script will allow you to get a Docker environment setup without having to know how the whole Docker system works. Of course, we always encourage you to understand the tools you are using but this is the real world and we know that sometimes, you just need a working system with a minimum of frustration.

### I already have MAMP / Homestead / Valet / Other, why do I need this?
Those other options are great and they may be better for your specific needs, but they didn't address the issues we were encountering so we built this! With this system, you can setup a project in seconds and change it from PHP 5.6 and MySQL 5.5 to PHP 7.1 and MySQL 5.7 and back again without any messy configuration.

If you're working on a site upgrade from EE2 to EE4 and you need to switch to PHP 7 after the upgrade, doing that on one of those other stacks may be time consuming or outright impossible without affecting all of your sites.

### What do you mean "without affecting all of your sites"?
This system creates a separate devstack for each of your projects. You want Project A on PHP 5.6 and MySQL 5.5 while Project B is on PHP 7.1 and MySQL 5.7? That's fine. You want to be able to delete Project A from your system entirely without affecting Project B? That's also fine.

### So what does this "devstack" script actually do?
When you run this script from the root folder of your project, it will prompt you to enter your project's public folder (if you have one), the PHP version you want, the MySQL version you want, and whether you want to setup a NGROK tunnel (exterior access for testing webhooks and such).

Once you have entered your choices, it'll create the following files:
  - `[your project]/_docker` folder
  - `[your project]/_docker/docker-compose.yml`
  - `[your project]/_docker/Dockerfile`
  - `[your project]/_docker/nginx.conf`
  - `[your project]/_docker/php-ini-overrides.ini`
  - `[your project]/docker.database.php`

After the files are created, the script will:
  - Launch a reverse proxy (you probably don't need to know much about this) to route traffic to your containers
  - Launch your Nginx container
  - Launch your MySQL container
  - Launch your PHP container

### Can I edit those files if I want to change my setup?
Yes / No. Most of the files are re-generated every time you run the "devstack" script so any changes you make would be overwritten.

The exception is the `[your project]/_docker/php-ini-overrides.ini` file which will not be overwritten once it exists in case you have made changes.

If you wish to make permanent changes to the other files for your setup, you can edit the files in this repo in the `_source` folder. Some of the settings are hard-coded inside the `devstack.sh` script itself and would need to be changed there.

### What is that `docker.database.php` file?
When you change your devstack, it changes the connection details for your database. To make it so you don't have to edit your ExpressionEngine config each time, you can just include that file in your config (or master config) at the bottom like so:
  - `include FCPATH.'docker.database.php';`

If your system folder is not in it's original position, you may need to add `../` or `../../` to get back to your project's root folder.

### What do I do if something goes wrong?
You can try reaching out to us but this is an unsupported project and we do not guarantee that you will receive a response.

### This system deleted my files / database!
You use this setup at your own risk. We have made efforts to make it easy to use but as with any dev system, if you have critical data you cannot lose, you should have backups of it!

## Environment

- Your code MUST live in `/code` at the root of your hard drive (not /Users/[youruser]/code). This is for consistency among developers. We may change this in the future but for now, that's how it is.

## Installation

- Install [Docker CE for Mac (Edge channel*)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac)
- Run Docker
- Edit `Docker Preferences > File Sharing` and add your `/code` folder
- Remove `/Users` from File Sharing
- Do **NOT** remove any other existing shared folders
- Click "Apply and Restart" button
- Install Kitematic from the Docker menu item (DO NOT download Docker Toolbox!)
- Clone this repo into `/code/docker`
- Make the script globally accessible by creating a symlink using the following terminal command
  - ln -sf /code/docker/devstack.sh /usr/local/bin/devstack

(* There are / were features in Edge that we're not sure if they rolled into the main release channel so for now, we recommend installing the Edge version)

## Usage
### Launching A Project
- `cd` into your `/code/[project name]` folder
- Type `devstack`
- Choose your Public Folder / PHP / MySQL / NGROK settings

### Stopping A Project
You can also stop a project by just running the normal `devstack` command and following the prompts.
- `cd` into your `/code/[project name]` folder
- Type `devstack stop`

### Restarting A Project
You can also restart a project by just running the normal `devstack` command and following the prompts.
- `cd` into your `/code/[project name]` folder
- Type `devstack restart`

## Using Kitematic
You can launch Kitematic at any time to see your running Docker containers. Clicking on a container will show the live feed of requests to that container (including errors) so you can use it for debugging purposes.

If you want to DELETE a container, click the X or click "Remove" (see caveat below).

If you want to STOP a container, we recommend using the devstack to stop your containers but in the event that fails or you want to do it manually, you can just click the container you want to stop and then click "Stop".

## Warnings / Caveats
- Docker for Mac must be running for devstack to work / your sites to load
- If you restart Docker, you will have to re-launch your projects
- If you click the X or "Remove" in Kitematic, you will DESTROY THAT CONTAINER and lose any data assocaited with it (i.e. Removing your MySQL container will delete any databases inside it for that project)
