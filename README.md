# Docker Dev Stack

This is the Docker setup we use here at PacketTide for developing client sites and ExpressionEngine add-ons.

It is designed to be flexible and easy to use without having to tangle yourself in the internals of the immensely powerful (and daunting) Docker.

It should take about 5-10 minutes to install this Devstack initially.

It currently setups of a stack of:

- NGINX
- MySQL 5.5, 5.6, or 5.7
- PHP 5.6, 7.0, 7.1
- ngrok (optional)
